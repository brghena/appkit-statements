        compile-time memory safety checks to help eliminate runtime bugs that

        for operating system development, and especially for embedded OS
        development, where recovery and debugging are particularly challenging.
        However, embedded platforms are highly event-based, and Rust's memory
        safety mechanisms largely presume threads. In our experience developing
        an operating system for embedded systems in Rust, we have found that
        Rust's {\em ownership} model prevents otherwise safe resource sharing
        common in the embedded domain, conflicts with the reality of hardware
        resources, and hinders using closures for programming asynchronously.
        We describe these experiences and how they relate to memory safety as
        well as illustrate our workarounds that preserve the safety guarantees
        to the largest extent possible. In addition, we draw from our
        experience to propose a new language extension to Rust that would
        enable it to provide better memory safety tools for event-driven
        platforms.

   Embedded systems have long been synonymous with special purpose, single
   stakeholder computing. However, as these systems have become more capable and
   the demands placed on them have become more varied and variable, embedded
   software is beginning to embrace multi-tenancy.
   While the general problem of supporting multiple users and processes on a
   computing platform has been well explored in computer science, the
   challenges of supporting multiple users with competing desires on a highly
   energy-variable system remain unexplored.
   On an energy-harvesting platform, incoming energy needs to be distributed
   between stakeholders, and users accessing shared platform resources should
   be charged for the energy use of those resources.
   Furthermore, with system designers and application creators being
   increasingly removed from each other, the software environments of
   energy-harvesting platforms must provide primitives that enable applications
   to adapt to system variability.
   We explore several initial techniques for solving these problems and
   demonstrate them using Signpost---a modular, energy-harvesting platform for
   city-scale sensing.

        and the Internet of Things. Sensor deployments often tend towards
        low-power communication protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE
        802.15.4. Gateways are essential to connect these devices to the
        Internet at large. Over time though, gateways have gained additional
        responsibilities as well. Sensors expect gateways to handle
        device-specific data translation and local processing while also
        providing services, such as time synchronization, to the low-power
        device. As a centralized computing resource, the gateway is also an
        obvious location for running local applications which interact with
        sensor data and control nearby actuators. Today, vendors and
        researchers often create their own device-specific gateways to handle
        these responsibilities.

        We propose a generic gateway platform capable of supporting the needs
        of many devices. In our architecture, devices provide a pointer, such
        as a URL, to descriptions of their interfaces. The gateway can download
        the interface descriptions and use them to determine how to interact
        with the device, translating its data to a usable format and enabling
        local services to communicate with it. The translated data is provided
        to services including user applications, local logging, device status
        monitoring, and cloud applications. By simultaneously supporting
        communication with many sensors, our gateway architecture can simplify
        future sensor network deployments and enable intelligent building
        applications.

        limited to developing new sensing applications, however. A sensor must
        be installed in a location. It must be provided power, storage, and
        communications. All these tasks stand aside from the desired sensing
        effort, but are necessary nevertheless.

        In this demo, we introduce an initial prototype for a modular,
        city-scale sensing platform---the signpost network. The platform,
        designed to be physically attached to sign posts throughout a city,
        reduces the burden for sensor and application developers by providing
        the necessary resources to modules attached to it. Power is provided by
        harvesting from solar panels with battery storage, with each module
        allocated a certain subset of the system energy. The signpost platform
        also provides data storage, long-range communication, data processing,
        module isolation, and an installation point for connected modules. The
        signpost acts as a modular base station for researchers, citizen
        scientists, and other interested parties to deploy custom sensors for
        applications such as pedestrian counting, air quality monitoring, and
        RF spectrum sensing at a city-wide scale.

    Long the case in automotive, aeronautics, and industrial settings, embedded
    systems in myriad other areas are becoming distributed systems in all but
    name. Driven by increasingly complex applications with wide-ranging
    hardware requirements, developers are turning to modular designs that
    integrate multiple processors onto a single board. Unfortunately,
    problems already familiar to distributed systems—coordinated execution,
    portable applications, and unified system-wide administration—have no
    corresponding embedded support and must be re-implemented in an ad hoc
    fashion for each application. We argue that future embedded operating
    system development should explicitly support these multi-microcontroller
    systems, and can leverage distributed techniques to do so. We also
    believe that the low-level nature of embedded sensing indicates that OSes
    should not attempt to completely abstract the presence of separate
    hardware components and capabilities. Instead, they should provide useful
    interfaces that support resource-constrained execution and modular
    application interactions. To that end, we identify existing embedded OS
    efforts and distributed systems concepts that can inform next-generation
    OS development.

    Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are a compelling answer to the
    networking challenges faced by many Internet of Things devices. Their
    combination of low power, long range, and deployment ease has motivated a
    flurry of research, including exciting results on backscatter and
    interference cancellation that further lower power budgets and increase
    capacity. But despite the interest, we argue that unlicensed LPWAN
    technologies can only serve a narrow class of Internet of Things
    applications due to two principal challenges: capacity and coexistence.

    We propose a metric, bit flux, to describe networks and applications in
    terms of throughput over a coverage area. Using bit flux, we find that the
    combination of low bit rate and long range restricts the use case of LPWANs
    to sparse sensing applications. Furthermore, this lack of capacity leads
    networks to use as much available bandwidth as possible, and a lack of
    coexistence mechanisms causes poor performance in the presence of multiple,
    independently-administered networks. We discuss a variety of techniques and
    approaches that could be used to address these two challenges and enable
    LPWANs to achieve the promise of ubiquitous connectivity.
