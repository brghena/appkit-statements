\opening{Dear Search Committee Members:}

%% Intro
I am writing to apply for an
%\hl{lecturer}
Assistant Faculty Associate
position in the
%\hl{School of Computer Science \& Engineering}
Department of Computer Sciences
at the
%\hl{University of Washington}.
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
%
I am currently completing my Ph.D.\ at the University of California, Berkeley
in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, where I
expect to complete my dissertation work during the summer of 2020.

%% Teaching
My teaching has covered a variety of experiences including
large lecture halls, small-group discussions, and individual mentoring.
%
This past summer I was an instructor of record for a 200 student computer
organization course at UC Berkeley, and in the prior fall I redesigned the lab
curriculum for Berkeley's embedded systems course.
%and created a new hardware and software platform to support
%student learning.
%
My experiences in teaching include topics in C programming, digital logic,
processor architecture, parallelism, and wireless networking.
%
%% Teaching desires
%My experiences have given me a broad set of skills across the hardware and
%software systems domains that I am excited to share with students.
%
I am particularly eager to teach
introductory systems courses such as computer organization or systems programming,
introductory programming or data structures courses,
upper-level systems courses such as computer architecture or operating systems,
and embedded systems courses at any level.

%% Research
My expertise as an embedded systems researcher spans multiple disciplines
including wireless communications, mobile computing, computer architecture, and
operating systems.
%
The focus of my work is the application of these domains toward understanding
and developing mechanisms to support the Internet of Things.
%
My research is often collaborative and has included mentorship of nine
undergraduates and two high school students, four of whom have gone on to
their own Ph.D.\ studies.

%% Who might be familiar with my work

%% Diversity
An important part of my teaching is creating an inclusive environment where
everyone is welcome. I listen and learn from my students and colleagues
in order to implement policies that will support diversity.
%
This includes steps like using anonymity while grading to avoid bias and hiring
a diverse course staff so students have role models to identify with in the community.

%% Enclosures
I have attached
%\hl{list here}.
my curriculum vitae,
%research statement,
list of references,
and teaching statement.
%and diversity statement.
In addition, I have attached teaching evaluations from courses I have taught
as an instructor or TA and an example of a previous syllabus.
%
Thank you very much for your consideration, and I look forward to your response.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
