\opening{Dear Search Committee Members:}

%% Intro
I am writing to apply for a
\hl{lecturer}
position in the
\hl{School of Computer Science \& Engineering}
at the
\hl{University of Washington}.
%
I am currently completing my Ph.D.\ at the University of California, Berkeley
in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, where I
expect to complete my dissertation work during the summer of 2020.

%% Teaching
My teaching has included a variety of experiences including
large lecture halls, small-group discussions, and individual mentoring.
%
This past summer I was an instructor of record for a 200 student computer
organization course at UC Berkeley, and in the prior fall I redesigned the lab
curriculum for Berkeley's embedded systems course.
%and created a new hardware and software platform to support
%student learning.

%% Research
As an embedded systems researcher, my focus spans several disciplines including
wireless communications, mobile computing, computer architecture, and operating
systems.
%
My research has been collaborative in nature and has included mentorship of
nine undergraduates and two high school students, four of whom have gone on to
pursue PhD positions.

%% Teaching desires
My experiences have given me a broad set of skills across the hardware and
software systems domains that I am excited to share with students.
%
I am particularly eager to teach
introductory systems courses such as computer organization or systems programming,
introductory programming or data structures courses,
upper-level systems courses such as computer architecture or operating systems,
and embedded systems courses at any level.
%

%% Who might be familiar with my work

%% Enclosures
I have attached
\hl{list here}.
%research statement,
%teaching statement,
%and diversity statement.
%In addition, I have attached teaching evaluations from courses I have taught
%as an instructor or TA.

Thank you very much for your consideration, and I look forward to your response.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
